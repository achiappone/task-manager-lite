## 🚀 Getting Started
```bash

npm run dev
```

## Cloud Backups
1. Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your API key:
   ```
   VITE_BACKUP_API_KEY=your-secret-key
   ```
2. (Optional) Override the API base URL if you are testing against a different host:
   ```
   VITE_BACKUP_API_BASE=https://api.anthonychiappone.com
   ```
3. Restart the dev server after editing environment variables.
4. Use the **Save to Cloud** / **Restore from Cloud** buttons inside the board toolbar. The app automatically pulls the latest backup on initial load and performs a debounced auto-backup (about every 90 seconds) while you make changes.
